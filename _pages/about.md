I am a Data Scientist (Optimization) in AI Research Center of [Hyundai Motor Group Innovation Center in Singapore](https://www.hyundai.com/sg/hmgics/about-us/vision-mission) (HMGICS).
I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at [Singapore Management University](https://www.smu.edu.sg/) in 2022, advised by Professor [Lau Hoong Chuin](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/hclau/).

My research focuses on the intersections between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Operations Research (OR), specifically how techniques from both fields of study can synergise to address real-world Combinatorial Optimization Problems (COPs) that are increasingly more complex and dynamic.

Motivated by the increasing complexity and dynamicity of COPs, my research aims to incorporate relevant techniques outside the OR domain specifically from the AI domain such as Machine Learning (ML) and Multi-Agent Planning (MAP) to supplement and complement the classical OR techniques to solve these problems with potential real-world implementation in mind particularly in the transportation/logistics and safety/security domains.

In my current role in HMGICS, I am working on both research and deployment projects related to the application of advanced AI and OR techniques in solving optimization problems in the context of smart manufacturing. 
- I developed and implemented multi-agent pathfinding algorithms for Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) in a Digital Twin simulator environment.
- I lead and drive research initiative to formulate and solve real-world multi-robot routing problem in smart factory context as a Multi-Agent Pickup and Delivery Problem (MAPD).
- I developed and deployed a novel algorithm to measure the factory's Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) and automate the root cause analysis process in a flexible cell-based car production.
- I developed model to analyse, visualize and simulate current performance of mobile robot operations.
