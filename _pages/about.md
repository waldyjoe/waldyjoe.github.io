I am a Data Scientist (Optimization) in AI Research Center of [Hyundai Motor Group Innovation Center in Singapore](https://www.hyundai.com/sg/home).
I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at [Singapore Management University](https://www.smu.edu.sg/) in 2022, advised by Professor [Lau Hoong Chuin](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/hclau/).

My research focuses on the intersections between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Operations Research (OR), specifically how techniques from both fields of study can synergise to address real-world Combinatorial Optimization Problems (COPs) that are increasingly more complex and dynamic.

Motivated by the increasing complexity and dynamicity of COPs, my research aims to incorporate relevant techniques outside the OR domain specifically from the AI domain such as Machine Learning (ML) and Multi-Agent Planning (MAP) to supplement and complement the classical OR techniques to solve these problems with potential real-world implementation in mind particularly in the transportation/logistics and safety/security domains.
